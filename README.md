# PyTorch Regression: Linear Regression using ANN

## Objective
This project aims to perform linear regression using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) implemented in PyTorch. The objective is to analyze the relationship between housing prices and the area in a dataset, build and train the ANN model, and evaluate its performance.

## Dataset Description
- **Dataset Name**: `Housing-1.csv`
- **Description**: This dataset contains information about housing prices and relevant features, including 'area' as the main feature used for predictions. The dataset includes various other features encoded for analysis.

## Steps to Run the Code in Colab
1. Open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
2. Click on **File** > **Upload notebook** to upload your `.ipynb` file.
3. Install the required libraries by running !pip install torch torchvision pandas sklearn matplotlib in a new cell.
4. Upload the Housing-1.csv file to Colab.
5. Ensure the `Housing-1.csv` dataset is uploaded to the same directory as your notebook.
6. Run all the cells in the notebook sequentially.

## Dependencies
The following libraries are required to run the code:
- `torch` (for PyTorch)
- `pandas` (for data manipulation)
- `numpy` (for numerical operations)
- `scikit-learn` (for data preprocessing and evaluation)
- `matplotlib` (for plotting)
